                      are somehow linked but I only read one. I learned how to
                      let go. Ah! I’m still learning it, but that’s where l
                      started the learning process from. The woman had to let
                      her cheating husband go for God to fix her and fix their
                      marriage. She really grew, as she went through God’s
                      dealings with her. I think about her sometimes when it’s
                      difficult for me to let something go. If Sierra (that’s
                      her name) can do it, I can.

                      nothing was working and even the days rolled by
                      hopelessly. On one of the hopeless days, I was led by
                      God’s Spirit to read a particular chapter of a book l had
                      inherited from my sister. That particular chapter
                      addressed my situation at the time and literally spoke to
                      my soul, reassuring me that there are lots of feats to
                      attain whether situations around seem like it or not. In
                      tears, I kept reading till my whole being accepted the
                      message of the book. That book was ‘Break Out’ by Joel

                      time and the emotions l’d been feeling just around that
                      time came into perspective. Yeah, I was confused quite
                      alright; confused because I was letting my emotions take
                      the lead. I knew what God had told me to do but it didn’t
                      add up. Instead of walking in faith, I succumbed to
                      despair. It morphed into other things and sank me into a
                      pit so deep l believed I wouldn’t even be able to describe
                      it. Reading that book helped me make sense of the chaos.
                      It also encouraged me to turn back to and stand firm in
                      faith. As Joe said in one chapter, God knows what’s best
                      for me. It’s alright to trust, and follow.”

                      and highly inspiring. Thank you.”“Several books have
                      impacted me. When I read a book—any book—I relate with at
                      least one of the characters, or more than one. I put
                      myself in their shoes and personalize their experiences.
                      It’s what makes reading very real to me I think a lot of
                      my favorite books are written by Francine Rivers. One of
                      her books is titled ‘The Masterpiece’. I learned quite a
                      lot from it. Grace, one of the main characters, had a
                      tough life. I could relate to that. But it didn’t shake
                      her faith in God, not at all. I also learned assertiveness
                      from her. Before reading the book, I would see something I
                      didn’t like and I still wouldn’t say anything. But I
                      learned to stand against things that don’t align to my
                      values.”"
