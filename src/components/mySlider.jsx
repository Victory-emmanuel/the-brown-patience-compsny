                  favorite books are written by Francine Rivers. One of her

                  I learned quite a lot from it. Grace, one of the main
                  characters, had a tough life. I could relate to that. But it
                  didn’t shake her faith in God, not at all. I also learned
                  assertiveness from her. Before reading the book, I would see
                  something I didn’t like and I still wouldn’t say anything. But
                  I learned to stand against things that don’t align to my
                  values.”"
