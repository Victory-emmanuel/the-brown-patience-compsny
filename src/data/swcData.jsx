      "I never knew I would need to sharpen my writing skills. It had never crossed my mind to take a writing class because I thought it was for only aspiring writers. That fateful week, Coach Brown reached out to me, because she felt led to send the information to me when the  scholarship application was ongoing. I searched my heart, and I remembered that that same week I was to help my sister reply to her client. I noticed her choice of words and searched my heart again. Then I found out that I really needed to sharpen my writing and communication skills. The Course began February 12, 2024. My expectations were to learn the Art, Style and Discipline of writings  that can pass an accurate and captivating information to my clients and mentees. And also to be able to communicate better with people, learning how to use the right expressions from my mind and thoughts. And also stun my world with beautiful write-ups. After the course: March 9, 2024. When she started this class with us, she began to introduce us to the elements of writing a story. From our Audience, to Attention, to Focus, to Emotions, Illustrations, Relatability,  Finding a story, SMS method, CTA. Then she gave us submissions alongside to help us practice. At a point when I saw the submissions, I would faint and wake up again encouraging myself that I needed this skill. üòÇ I am into the Fashion Business. And I discovered that this class was helping me also in paying attention to intrinsic details of my clients‚Äô preferences. So, as the classes went on, I found out that it was helping me also to pay close attention to sketches and shapes. I know this has nothing to do with write-ups, but it did something to my sight. Along the line, I discovered that I used to have one passion that had been discarded for a long time ‚Äî to write books and share my life experiences with stories.  As we went deeper in the classes, the passion came back. Especially the day we were taught about 'Emotions'. There's one particular line I hold dearly from this class: Inside you is the most authentic story no one else can write. So I have decided not to hold all of these stories back to myself. No one is ever going to hear them until I write  them out. When we started our LIRI journey, I realized how bad my sentence construction was. Thank God! I first wrote the chapter by pen in my book, then I typed it again. I knew it was a tedious work for me, but I had to do it that way. Because I know it will improve my writing. And it actually did! Doing my resubmissions, my eyes were following all the wrong things I had been doing in my write-ups, especially my punctuation marks. It was so bad. But now it has changed. Talking about being able to make write-ups that can stun my world, the cheat code I have been using for any write-up task is just to pay attention to the events around me. Writing it the way it played out! No emotions held back. I've found out that every day is a story! Thank you, Coach Brown Patience, for introducing me into this class. Thank you for pouring your all to see that we all attained the goals for which we signed up for this class. And not to discard this, thank you for being patient with us all.‚ÄúCome and take all my flowers in the garden‚Äù like you normally say.",

      "The course began Feb 12, 2024. My expectation was that the class will take me a step further in fulfilling God's plan for my life by making me a great story teller. After the course: 19th April, 2024. I make bold to see that my expectations have been met and surpassed. I say this because not only have I learnt to be a great storyteller, I've also been taught to *believe* in me and my message. Before I took the class, I was struggling with putting out the things I was writing. I just didn't see the need to share them with anyone. But now I know better. I've learnt that the world needs to hear the message I have to share. I've learnt to share my message, with courage.",

I had no idea what you would be teaching us when I started this course‚Äîexcept that I should know how to write compelling stories in the end. It's April 15. And I've learnt so much that I now feel confident when writing‚Äîalthough the impersonating Lekan occasionally resurfaces. But I feel different. I feel like a writer. I'm beginning to think more like a writer. And henceforth, I won't just write. But I'll pay attention to what I write: my emotions; my choice of illustrations; my punctuations; my paragraphs. I'll also be more observant. And with more deliberate practice, and with time, I'll hone this art. I'll be better at it. Like you, I'd also inspire others. I'd be very good at this thing.So, yes! This course has served me well. Even beyond my expectations. And I have you to thank for that.",

I have surpassed my expectations. Coach did not stop at helping me express myself better through writing but broke things down and made me understand why I am writing the story, who my audience is, the feelings and emotions put into writing,  what makes the story catchy and keeps the reader going and so on. The depth of the lectures would definitely keep me going for a long time. A big shout out to Coach Patience and my one and only partner,  Sarah. Thanks for the support so far, and I do hope to write contents that will make you a proud Coach in the nearest future. Gracias.",

      "April 30, 2023. At first, when I enrolled into this class, I didn‚Äôt really have any purpose of joining then. I knew I was lacking in one aspect or the other in terms of punctuations and the rest. Thank God, now I can say that I'm better. Before I joined this class, I knew I needed to work on myself on the use of exclamation marks. So I was actually looking for a way I could learn it. Thank God for Aanu. Though, by the time she was telling me about this class, I wasn't really getting the full concept of the course, but I saw it as a way to improve myself. So I joined since I knew that I'd gain something plus keep myself busy and add value to my life during my first semester holiday. When I joined this class, you were able to open my eyes to the use of commas, letting me know the places where I was using them unnecessarily.  Then you taught me the use of exclamation marks. So I can say that I'm better at the use of exclamation marks and also the use of commas.",

Now, I not only have the courage but also the knowledge to begin my journey. I used to believe I lacked the creativity to write a fictional book, but now, with all I have learned, the only limit is myself. ",

This experience has exceeded all my expectations‚Äîit's been truly amazing! Rewriting Priye has opened my eyes to the importance of punctuation and paragraphing. I've gained extensive knowledge in writing and editing. The class has also helped me enhance my writing skills. Now, whenever I write or respond to messages, I put everything I've learned into practice. I'm able to clearly express my thoughts in writing while keeping in mind the audience I'm addressing. These past few weeks have been incredible, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my writing abilities.Thank you, dear coach, for instilling in us such valuable wisdom and insight. God bless you!",

      "At the beginning of the class, I remember how I mentioned that I expected to get better at writing. As of today, I must say that I'm getting better because the class taught me the power of storytelling. Storytelling is that powerful to get your readers to feel the emotions you felt while writing or the emotions you want them to feel(that's if you want them to 'feel' those emotions). I understood vividly the power of telling a story to capture the attention of your audience. Although one could have written based on what the person knows how to but to get consistent, I understood that there's always inspiration to write. It's not far-fetched. Inspiration is all around me. Lastly, as compelling as the class and stories being shared during the class have been, I've started paying rapt attention to punctuation. As every element of writing does matter, punctuations matter too.",
