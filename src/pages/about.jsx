              </h2>
              <p className="mb-6 font-light text-secondary md:text-lg dark:text-primary">
                I remember having this 40 or 60-leaves book back in secondary
                school. That was 2014. I was in SS2 "if you're unfamiliar with
                Nigeria's education system, SS2 is one class away from
                highschool graduation". I wrote stories in that notebook. A few
                friends read them and I was so proud of those stories. Then the
                book got missing. It was painful. So painful that I haven't
                forgotten the feeling. Still in that 2014, I won a national
                essay writing competition. The way the newspapers put it, they
                were shocked a public school pupil had come out tops. I still
                giggle when I read that headline.
                <p className="mt-4">
                  As a teen, I wrote for fun. I wrote to relieve boredom. I
                  could be sitting in a place and mentally remove myself from
                  there by scribbling a letter to an imaginary cousin in Vienna.
                  Nevermind that I had no idea if Vienna was actually a place.
                  Writing was how I went to places I wished I could be. As soon
                  as the English Language teacher said, “Write a letter to your
                  uncle in London,” it was my lucky day! All these should have
                  told me writing was the path for me, but I couldn't have
                  known. I said I'd be a banker when I grew up; I set my mind on
                  pursuing accounting in college. And that's precisely what I
                  did. Yet purpose can and will find you.

              The Epiphany
            </h4>
            <p className="mb-6 text-secondary dark:text-primary">
              I wasn't bad at accounting as an undergrad. In fact, I gained a
              reputation in my set as one of the people with the most
              explanatory course notes. You want a person that can write down
              everything the lecturer dictated or explained? Brown Patience is
              one of them! Still, it didn't click. Writing didn't take
              preeminence in my pursuits. Not yet. I was in my finals at the
              University of Lagos when the pandemic sent us home for 9 months.
              2020, yeah. In those 9 months, I had nothing to do but read. And
              write. And pray. I worried too. Worried about what I was supposed
              to do to make ends meet. When we resumed, accounting was no longer
              looking like the road for me. During those 9 months when I did a
              lot of reading and writing, worrying and praying, I got an answer.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-secondary dark:text-primary">
              I like to tell my friends that the pandemic slowed us down long
              enough to find ourselves. We slowed down long enough to hear our
              own thoughts, to find what we'd rather pursue. It had always been
              there — on the inside of us — but we had always been busy with the
              tasks at hand, excelling at whatever we found to do, almost never
              giving passion a thought. I have friends who returned from the
              pandemic and made U-turns. I was one of those who slowed down long
              enough to realize I wanted to write. God finally got through to
              me. I began giving writing a good look. It came when I asked,
              “God, what should I be doing?”
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-secondary dark:text-primary">
              So if you ask me what my motivation is, what my reason is, I'll
              say “God.” A thousand times over. Outside God, without God's
              leading, there's nothing to Brown Patience. Had God not led me
              here, I wouldn't be here. In the last quarter of 2021, the Lord
              had simply said to me, “I want you to teach story writing.” Look
              where we are now. I'm a Christian! You may have figured that out
              by now. I follow Jesus. I want to keep following Jesus. One of my
              favourite parts of Scripture reads: “I'll run the course you lay
              out for me if you'll just show me how. God, teach me lessons for
              living so I can stay the course. Give me insight so I can do what
              you tell me — my whole life one long, obedient response” (Psalm
              119:32-35, MSG). I have no other plan for my life but to follow
              God's plan.

            <p className="my-4  text-secondary dark:text-primary">
              It seems like it started in Apapa, Lagos. In a public primary
              school where I discovered I really liked comprehension passages,
              where I represented my school in Spelling Bee competitions. And
              then a public secondary school where my English Language teacher
              encouraged me to write, where I found out that words were easy to
              piece together, that my imagination could run with dizzying speed,
              that I could forge stories only from wanting to. But even before
              those, it started with God's
              <b className="font-bold  text-secondary dark:text-primary">
                gift
              </b>
              . He gave me this talent; He's been leading me on how to put it to
              fruit-bearing use. Over my life, He'll reap much harvest. And I'll
              be able to say, like Jesus, “I have brought you glory on earth by
              finishing the work you gave me to do” (John 17:4, NIV).

                I consider writing a change-provoking art. Books have molded my
                life and the lives of many before now. Every person who has ever
                had anything to say has encouraged us to glean the wisdom in
                books. So I encourage others to write. I help them write. I poke
                them unrelentingly, supporting them to go ahead and share their
                message. My writing students, my book writing or editing
                clients, the clients that run blogs and newsletters, I'm their
                chief cheerleader! “You've got a message to share? please go
                ahead and share it.” It's my anthem! Writing is a
                change-provoking art. It's why we read. It's why we write. It's
                why The Brown Patience Company exists. To ensure you have all
                the help you need to share the message you need to share —
                clearly, compellingly. And then the harvest! We wait for the
                harvest in the lives of people. For surely, the harvest comes.
